Steps to run the game:
	
	1. Go to GameWindow.java file
	2. Run "GameWindow" which has the main method in it which would launch the game
	3. It would open a prompt window, whether to start a new game or customise the defaults
	4. Control the paddle with the help of left/right arrow keys OR keys "a" for left and "d" for right movement
	5. Make sure the ball hits the paddle every time is descends.
	6. If the ball misses the paddle and hits the ground, it is Game Over
	7. You can also add a few customisations of your own at the start of the game.
	8. The speed of the ball might vary depending upon which type of brick it hits
	9. Not every brick on the set breaks in 1 hit, it depends upon the strength of each one. (Light yellow ==> Weak, Crimson ==> Strong)
